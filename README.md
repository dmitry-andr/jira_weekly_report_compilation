Python script to build weekly report from Jira data using JQL
To configure connection parameters and JQL params - use settings.ini.
NOTE !!! Script was tested only with Chrome Selenuim driver
This file is loaded before script launch
To get generate all reports launch scipt with parameter "all" - this must be done carefully as may be heavy and time consuming operation. 
To get list of available reports just launch script without any params. You'll see warining message with list of available reports.
